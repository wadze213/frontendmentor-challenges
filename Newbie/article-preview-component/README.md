## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- SASS & SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This challenge was used as a a way to refresh my memory, I learnt nothing new but gained back lost confidence. The reason my challenge output lowered is because I was studying mySQL and databses for the past few weeks, paired with the bootcamp mini-project two dev and presentation I was working on.

### Continued development

This exercise is one that I am making to get back into front-end development. Next will be a larger challenge.
